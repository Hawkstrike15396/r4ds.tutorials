1) Read the general instructions for writing tutorials:

https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/articles/instructions.html

Even if you have read it before, you ought to read it again.

2)  Do one or two of the tutorials before you start working on your own. One of them should be the 21-spreadsheets tutorial. The below examples are taken from it.

3) Make your Introduction look like this:

This tutorial covers [Chapter 21: Spreadsheets](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/spreadsheets.html) from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. You will learn how to get data from Excel spreadsheets using  `[read_excel()](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/reference/read_excel.html)` from the [**readxl**](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) package and Google sheets using `[read_sheet()](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/range_read.html)` from the [**googlesheets4**](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/) package.

  * The first sentence provides a link to your chapter as well as to R4DS.
  * We highlight some the most important packages and functions used in the tutorial.
  * We don't go overboard. You can't mention every package or every function used in the tutorial.

4) Make your Summary look like this:

This tutorial covered [Chapter 21: Spreadsheets](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/spreadsheets.html) from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. You have learned how to get data from Excel spreadsheets using  `[read_excel()](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/reference/read_excel.html)` from the [**readxl**](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) package and Google sheets using `[read_sheet()](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/range_read.html)` from the [**googlesheets4**](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/) package.

Read “[Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989)” by Karl Broman and Kara Woo for great advice about organizing your data using spreadsheets.

  * The first paragraph is identical to the Introduction, expected that "covers" is replaced with "covered." We began the tutorial with a promise about what students would learn. One hopes that we kept that promise.
  * The second paragraph gives one or two pointers about the best material which a student might look into if she is interested in learning more about the broad topic of the tutorial. These pointers were also mentioned as knowledge drops earlier in the tutorial.
  * These pointers will often (always?) be items which were mentioned in R4DS itself. Those authors have excellent taste!
