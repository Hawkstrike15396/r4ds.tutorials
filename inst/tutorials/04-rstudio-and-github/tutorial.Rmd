## Introduction
### 

<!-- DK: How do we link to a different tutorial in this package? -->

This tutorial covers material which is not actually in [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. But the material is in keeping with the spirit of that book. The material covered in [Chapter 4 Workflow: code style](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-style.html) appears in the *RStudio and Code* tutorial in this package.

Professionals store their work on Github, or a similar "source control" tool. If your computer blows up, you don't want to lose your work. Github is like Google Drive --- both live in the cloud --- but for your statistical work rather than your documents. 

This tutorial will introduce you to Github and to Git, a program for keeping track of changes in your code.

The most useful reference for Git/Github/RStudio is *[Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)*. Search that book whenever you have a problem.

## Terminal Overview
### 

<!-- To be completed, but keeping the terminal commands in tutorial for now. -->

The RStudio [Terminal](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/terminal.html) is how you directly communicate with the computer using commands, whereas the RStudio [Console](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/console.html) is how you talk to R. 

This section will help introduce you to the Terminal so that you'll be up to speed for the commands needed for the rest of the tutorial.


### Exercise 1

Start by opening up the Terminal tab in RStudio. This is next to the Console tab, within the Console pane. 

```{r out.width = "700px"}
include_graphics("images/terminalEx1.png")
```

### 

You should see some text, which is your file path followed by a prompt such as a dollar sign. Copy (by highlighting, then right clicking and selecting the "copy" option) and paste your path (like the example above) into the box below. 


```{r terminal-overview-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

We abbreviate these instructions to **c**opy/**p**aste the **c**ommand/**r**esponse as CP/CR throughout this tutorial.


### Exercise 2

To practice, try pasting the command `pwd` into the next line of your Terminal and hit return. CP/CR.


```{r terminal-overview-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

This should return a value something like `/Users/dkane/Desktop/projects/`. Your answer will be different, not least because your username is unlikely to be `dkane`. This is the location on your computer where the R program started up when you opened RStudio.

### 

That's all you need to know about the Terminal for this tutorial. You will be completing a separate "Terminal" dedicated tutorial in the future. Make sure to pay special attention to whether given commands are supposed to be run in the *Console* or the *Terminal*.

## Setting up GitHub
### 

GitHub is an online drive for all your R code and projects. In the professional world, what you have on your GitHub account is more important than what you have on your resume. It is a verifiable demonstration of your abilities.

### Exercise 1

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) by following the instructions of the [Install Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) chapter in [*Happy Git and GitHub for the useR*](https://happygitwithr.com/).

### 

After you install Git, you should quit and then restart RStudio so that it has a chance to "recognize" that Git is installed. (Note that restarting RStudio is **not** the same as restarting your R session **within** your RStudio instance. To quit RStudio you need to go to the `RStudio -> Quit RStudio` menu item.) 

After restarting RStudio, click on the Terminal pane. Run `git --version` in the Terminal to make sure that Git is installed and accessible. 


```{r out.width = "700px"}
include_graphics("images/terminalEx2.png")
```

### 

CP/CR.

```{r setting-up-github-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

[*Pro Git*](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the best reference book for Git and Github.

### Exercise 2

The next step is to create a GitHub account by following the instructions at the [GitHub homepage](https://github.com/). Follow [this advice](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice) **when choosing your username.**

```{r}
include_graphics("images/github_account_creation.png")
```

### 

Copy your GitHub account URL in the field below. It should look like:

<https://github.com/your-username>

```{r setting-up-github-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is "software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development."

### Exercise 3

Now that you have your GitHub account, you need to connect it to RStudio. The first step of doing this is giving RStudio your GitHub account email and your name.

### 

<!-- Ran into an issue here where `usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "your-username", user.email = "your@email.org")` would produce an error if you had multiple `user.name`s or `user.email`s saved (this can be checked using `usethis::git_sitrep()`). To fix this, I first used the terminal command `git config --global --replace-all user.name "newname"`. However, there seemed to be an issue where the terminal would say it is replaced but it wasn't being recognized. In the end, I was able to locate the actual global git config file under `C:/User/username/` and edit it directly. In the file, there were fields formatted like `name = ...` and `email = ...`. Deleting these lines completely seemed to work correctly. Afterwards (Good to restart R session here), running `usethis::git_sitrep()` will show that the fields are not set and you should now be able to run `usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "your-username", user.email = "your@email.org")` without error. -->

Run `usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "your-username", user.email = "your@email.org")` in the Console, substituting the email and name you used for your GitHub account. Note that this will not return anything. As long as you don't get an error message, it has worked.

### 

Run `git config --global user.name` in the *Terminal* to make sure your computer remembers your GitHub username. CP/CR

```{r setting-up-github-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### Exercise 4

Then, run `git config --global user.email` in the *Terminal* to make sure your GitHub email is stored too.

CP/CR

```{r setting-up-github-4}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

Now, your GitHub username and email are stored so that your computer can automate a lot of the tedious actions required to communicate with GitHub.

### Exercise 5

**Note:** Make sure you received the expected outputs of the name and email associated with your Github account for the last two exercises.

If GitHub is our Google Drive, GitHub repositories, or "repos", are the Google folders where we store our work. Let's make a practice repo!

To begin, sign into GitHub and go to the homepage. Click the green "New" button on the left of the website.

```{r out.width = "700px"}
include_graphics("images/github_new_repo.png")
```

Name your repository `First_Repo`. Then, select the "public" option for your repo and check the box saying "Add a README file". [README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) is a document where programmers often add or explain details of their project. When in doubt follow [these instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html#make-a-repo-on-github).

After you've done that, go ahead and click "Create repository" to create your first repo!

```{r out.width = "700px"}
include_graphics("images/repo_detail.png")
```

### 

GitHub should have directed you to a page called the project page after creating the repo. Copy the url of the project page and paste it below. The url should look something like `github.com/your-username/First_Repo`.

```{r setting-up-github-5}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

The "public" option means that anyone will be able to view the repository. Only you can edit it. You might have noticed "Add .gitignore" as another option, but we we will never check this option because RStudio will automatically create a `.gitignore` file for us.

### Exercise 6

The next step will be to create the exact same project in your local computer through the process of **cloning**. By having a local and a GitHub version, you can edit your project on your computer and send all the changes you've made to GitHub, so the GitHub version can be synced up with your local version.

To clone the repo, click on the green button that says "Code". Then, copy the link shown. You can use the clipboard button on the right to automatically copy it.

```{r out.width = "875px"}
include_graphics("images/repo_clone.png")
```

### 

Paste the link below.

```{r setting-up-github-6}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

This link points to your project folder stored in GitHub. It is slightly different from the url of the project page because the `.git` suffix tells you that it's a special GitHub object and not a webpage.

You've created a new repository on GitHub.

Now, let's connect your `First_Repo` repository to RStudio.


### Exercise 7

We start by making a new project. While you are making a new project, you will not be able to access this tutorial. Read **all instructions** before making your project.

### 

Click the dropdown menu in the top right of the R Studio window, and click "New Project".

Now, instead of clicking "New Directory" like we did previously, click on "Version Control". Then, click on "Git". These screens should look like the ones shown below.

In the following screen, paste the link you copied from GitHub into "Repository URL". Then make sure your project is in the `projects` directory you made in the RStudio and Code tutorial. If it is not, click on "Browse...", and select your `projects` folder. Click "Create Project".

Here's a quick pic displaying the process.

```{r}
include_graphics("images/new_git_project.png")
```

### 

Navigate to the Terminal tab and run `git remote -v`. Then copy and paste both the command and the output into the space below. The output should contain the original link you pasted.

<!-- Delete? **Note:** If the output does not contain the link, try switching from Terminal to the Console tab and run `system("git remote -v")`. If the output still does not contain the link, stop the tutorial and **reach out on Discord for help**. -->

```{r setting-up-github-7}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

You've successfully linked a repo to RStudio!

### Exercise 8

Now, you've linked your GitHub repo to your project, but you haven't proven that you are someone with editing access to the project. If we just let anyone with the GitHub link edit, that's obviously going to lead to problems with security down the line. This is why we use something called a **P**ersonal **A**ccess **T**oken, or a **PAT**.

### 

A PAT is just a special computer-generated password between your computer and GitHub that lets GitHub connect your GitHub account and your computer. If you want to learn more, see section "[Personal access token for HTTPS](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html)" from [*Happy Git and GitHub for the useR*](https://happygitwithr.com/)

### 

Create a PAT by using the `usethis::create_github_token()` function in the Console. This should redirect you to a GitHub page about creating a PAT.

### 

Set the "Note" field to "My First PAT" and keep the scopes the same as the **default**. It should look something like the picture below (Doesn't have to be exact).

```{r out.width = "625px"}
include_graphics("images/pat.png")
```

### 

Press "Generate Token" at the bottom of the page to finalize your PAT.

### Exercise 9

Now that we've created our PAT, first temporarily copy and paste it somewhere you have easy access to (ex: notes). We will store it in RStudio to make sure the computer doesn't forget.

### 

Run `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` in the Console and follow the prompts, providing your token when asked.

### 

Now, restart your R session. Remember to do this in the session where your github repo is running, **not the session where the tutorial is**. Restart your R session by going to "Session" at the top bar and clicking the option to Restart R, which should be under that tab. Then run `usethis::git_sitrep()` in the Console and copy-paste the result in the space below.

```{r setting-up-github-9}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

It should look similar to this:

```{r}
include_graphics("images/sitrep.png")
```

If there are any errors, you may need to recreate your PAT and go through the process again.

### Exercise 10

It's also a good idea to save your GitHub PAT to your `.Renviron` file. This is a file that stores information on your computer rather than on your project, making it a safe place to store sensitive information like your GitHub PAT or API keys.

### 

Run `usethis::edit_r_environ()` in the Console to open your `.Renviron` file. If you can't open the file, it's likely due to you using OneDrive or a cloud drive service to store your projects. **Please store your projects on your own computer in order to prevent future errors**.

### 

Add the line `GITHUB_PAT=` and your GitHub PAT in the first line of your .Renviron file and save it. Make sure your PAT is surrounded with "quotes" because it is a string.

It should look something like this.

```{r}
include_graphics("images/save-pat.png")
```

### 

Run `Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT")` in the Console. CP/CR. 

```{r setting-up-github-10}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

If you are nervous about sharing your GITHUB_PAT, feel free to change it after your copy/paste it into the answer. That is, we don't need to know your real GITHUB_PAT. We just want to ensure that your set up is correct.

### 

Packages like **usethis** will read your .Renviron file and access the `GITHUB_PAT` variable, so make sure that you use the correct formatting and name your variables correctly.

## Updating .gitignore
### 

One of the first things you should do when working with a new repo is updating the `.gitignore` file. You can open this file from the bottom right window under the Files tab. The purpose of `.gitignore` is to list all the files that you don't want to be uploaded to GitHub. This can come in handy when you are working with big datasets or files with private information.

### Exercise 1

Open the `.gitignore` and add `*.Rproj`. The \* tells your computer that we want to prevent all files ending in `.Rproj` from being uploaded. You could also just add `First_Repo.Rproj`.

```{r}
include_graphics("images/rproj.png")
```

### Exercise 2

Save the `.gitignore` file and on your top right panel, navigate to the Git tab. You should see `.gitignore` listed but not `First_Repo.Rproj`. The Git tab shows all the changes you have made on your local computer. Since you added `First_Repo.Rproj` in `.gitignore`, it shouldn't show up as one of the changed files that the GitHub version should be synced with.

If you do see `First_Repo.Rproj`, try clicking on the refresh button --- a small clockwise swirl --- in the upper right. Or make sure you have it spelled correctly.

```{r}
include_graphics("images/updated_gitignore.png")
```

### 

Run `readLines(".gitignore")` in the Console. CP/CR.

```{r updating-gitignore-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

This should output all of the lines in your `.gitignore` file, which should include `*.Rproj`.

### Exercise 3

Now that we've updated our `.gitignore` file, we want to upload this new version to GitHub. Otherwise, GitHub doesn't know that we want to hide our `.Rproj` file.

### 

To do so, go to the Git tab in the top right of your screen. Click the checkbox next to the `.gitignore` file and then click on the `Commit` button.

```{r}
include_graphics("images/commit.png")
```

### 

This will open a new window where you will write a commit message. The message is meant to note what you're adding/changing within the repo. And yes, it's mandatory. Just a few (sensible) words are enough.

### Exercise 4

Let's fill out this window.

### 

Check all of the boxes on the left-hand side. Then, write the commit message "Updated .gitignore" and press `Commit`.

<!-- Add to close pop-up window that appears after pressing commit. -->

<!-- Image is weird, need to change to get rid of the `push` arrow. -->

```{r}
include_graphics("images/commit_push.png")
```

### 

Run `gert::git_log() |> select(-commit, -merge, -files) |> slice(1)` in the console, which returns the author, time, and message of the last commit. If the error "could not find slice function" is thrown then load the library "dplyr" with `library(dplyr)` and try again. CP/CR.

```{r updating-gitignore-4}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### Exercise 5

Next, press `Push`, i.e.,  the green arrow on the top right. This pushes or uploads the changes to GitHub! Open up GitHub and refresh the project page to see the  commit message you just made at the top of your repo page.

### 

Run `gert::git_ahead_behind()$ahead` in the Console. CP/CR.

```{r updating-gitignore-5}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

This should return `0`, showing that you are 0 commits out of sync with the GitHub version.

## Publishing to R Pubs
### 

Let's publish a file from our project onto the internet using [R Pubs](https://rpubs.com/).

### Exercise 1

First let's make a new Quarto document. Select `File -> New File -> Quarto Document`. Change the title to "Example" and keep the other fields as the default values. Save the file with `Cmd/Ctrl - s` and name the file `example`. RStudio will automatically add the `.qmd` suffix.

### 

Run `list.files()`. CP/CR.

```{r publishing-to-r-pubs-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

You should see `example.qmd` somewhere in the output.

### Exercise 2

Render this Quarto document by pressing the "Render" button.

### 

Run `list.files()` in the Console and copy-paste the output below.

```{r publishing-to-r-pubs-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

`example.html` should be one of the files outputted.

### Exercise 3

Notice the blue button at the top of your qmd. Click that and select Rpubs. Choose a slug --- the file name for the last part of the url --- like "my-project" and publish. Put the URL of your Rpubs Page below:

```{r publishing-to-r-pubs-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

If you did not select a slug, then Rpubs provided a meaningless slug, most likely a string of numbers. That does not look cool! Much better to have a slug which describes the file.

### Exercise 4

In the "Git" tab in the top right corner, check the boxes next to "example.qmd", and "example.html" to stage them. Press the commit button and add the commit message "published webpage".

### 

Now, press the `Push` button with the green arrow. Your changes have now been saved to Github!

### 

Run `gert::git_ahead_behind()$ahead` in the Console. Copy and paste the command and result below. This should return "0" just like before.

```{r publishing-to-r-pubs-4}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

Nice work! You've created another Rpubs page and your changes should be saved to GitHub.


<!-- DK: Add three exercises --- like Project 1, Project 2 and Project 3 --- each of which starts with a new Github repo, connects to RStudio, edits the .gitignore, commits, create a Quarto doc, creates a plot and published on RPubs. -->

## Project 1
### 

<!-- DK: Insert some text explaining things, connecting to RStudio and Code examples. -->

### Exercise 1

Create a Github repo (called "project-1"). Make sure to click the "Add a README file" check box. Copy/paste the url for its Github location.

```{r project-1-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like:

```
https://github.com/davidkane9/project-1
```

It is a good idea to always start a new data science project with a Github repo.


### Exercise 2

Connect the `project-1` Github repo to an R project on your computer. Name the R project `project-1` also. Keeping the names of repos/projects aligned makes organization simpler. From the Terminal, run `ls`. CP/CR.

```{r project-1-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like this:

```
Davids-MBP:project-1 dkane$ ls
README.md               project-1.Rproj
Davids-MBP:project-1 dkane$
```

The default README has an "md" suffix to indicate that it is a **M**ark**d**own document.

RStudio will automatically restart and place you within the `project-1` R project. You should also have a directory called `project-1` in the location in which you store your projects.

### Exercise 3

Go to File, New File, Quarto Document. Name it `Quarto-1`. From the Terminal, run `ls`. CP/CR.

```{r project-1-3}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Place correct answer here.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

To produce a complete report containing all text, code, and results, click “Render” or press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K. You can also do this programmatically with `quarto::quarto_render("Quarto-1.qmd")`. This will display the report in the viewer pane and create an HTML file.

### Exercise 4

Switch to source. Delete everything except the top box with title, format, and editor. CP/CR everything in the quarto doc here.

```{r project-1-4}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Place correct answer here.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

When you render the document, Quarto sends the .qmd file to **knitr**, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and its output. The markdown file generated by **knitr** is then processed by pandoc, which is responsible for creating the finished file.

### Exercise 5

Add a code chunk and within it put `library(tidyverse)`, `library(tidyverse)`, `library(tutorial.helpers)`, `library(tidyverse)`, `library(palmerpenguins)`. Run code. Save the doc and name it Quarto-1.( Keep the .qmd). CP/CR everything in the quarto doc here.

```{r project-1-5}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Place correct answer here.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

In the visual editor you can either use the buttons on the menu bar to insert images, tables, cross-references, etc. or you can use the catch-all `⌘ /` shortcut to insert just about anything. If you are at the beginning of a line, you can also enter just `/` to invoke the shortcut.

### Exercise 6

We need to make it so that we do not see this code or the output in the Quarto Doc. To do this, we will put `#| echo: false` and `#| output: false` before `library(tidyverse)` in the code chunk. CP/CR everything in the quarto doc here.

```{r project-1-6}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Place correct answer here.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

`#| echo: false` makes it so that the code in the code chunk does not appear in the rendered Quarto Doc.`#| output: false` makes it so that the output of the code chunk does not appear in the rendered Quarto Doc. So, the previous code makes the whole code chunk with the libraries in it not visible in the final doc.

### Exercise 7

Add a new code chunk, and type `Penguins`. Run code. CP/CR the output.

```{r project-1-7}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Place correct answer here.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Inserting images and customizing how they are displayed is also facilitated with the visual editor. You can either paste an image from your clipboard directly into the visual editor (and RStudio will place a copy of that image in the project directory and link to it) or you can use the visual editor’s Insert > Figure / Image menu to browse to the image you want to insert or paste it’s URL. In addition, using the same menu you can resize the image as well as add a caption, alternative text, and a link.

### Exercise 8

Before `penguins`, add `#| echo: false` and `#| warning: false`. It should give you a tibble: 344 × 8.

```{r project-1-8}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The `#| echo: false` makes it so that the code in the code chunk does not appear in the rendered Quarto Doc.`#| warning: false` makes it so that the warning of the code chunk does not appear in the Quarto Doc. Now, we will create a simple plot.

### Exercise 9

Pipe `penguins` into `ggplot()`, and within `ggplot()`, set `mapping = aes()`. Set `x` to `body_mass_g` and `y` to `flipper_length_mm`. Type `tail -n 7 Quarto-1.qmd` in terminal and CP/CR the answer here.

```{r project-1-9}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Place correct answer here.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

`tail -n 7 Quarto-1.qmd` gives you the last 7 lines of your `Quarto-1.qmd` document. You can change the amount of lines you see by changing the 7 to another number. 

### Exercise 10

Within`aes()`, set `color` to `species` to sort the graph by the species and add `geom_point` function with `+`. Run `tail -n 7 Quarto-1.qmd`in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r project-1-10}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Place correct answer here.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

The visual editor has many more features that we haven’t enumerated here that you might find useful as you gain experience authoring with it.

Most importantly, while the visual editor displays your content with formatting, under the hood, it saves your content in plain Markdown and you can switch back and forth between the visual and source editors to view and edit your content using either tool.

### Exercise 11

Add `labs()` with `+`. Set `title` to `"Penguins Body Mass compared to Flipper Length"`, `x` to `"Body Mass"`, and `y` to `"Flipper Length"`.  Run `tail -n 10 Quarto-1.qmd` in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r project-1-11}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Place correct answer here.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

###

### Exercise 12

Render `Quarto-1.qmd`, either by hitting the "Render" button or by using `Cmd/Cntl-shift-K`. 

```{r project-1-12}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Run `list.files()` from the Console. CP/CR.


### Exercise 13

Next to the green code chunk button at the top right of your Quarto Doc, you should see a blue circle button. That is the publish button. Click that, then click Rpubs, then click publish. Change the name from `Document` to `Quarto-1.qmd`. Copy the url of your website below.

```{r project-1-13}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Place correct answer here.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

<!-- DK: How about cleaning up this whole thing before we end? Edit the .gitignore by adding `quarto-1_files`. Then, commit and push everything. test this with `git log | head -n 10`. -->

## Project 2
### 

The most important set of options controls if your code block is executed and what results are inserted in the finished report:

`eval: false`, `include: false`, `echo: false`, `message: false`, `results: hide`, `error: true` 

As you work more with knitr, you will discover that some of the default chunk options don’t fit your needs and you want to change them.

### Exercise 1

Create a Github repo (called "project-2"). Make sure to click the "Add a README file" check box. Copy/paste the url for its Github location.

```{r project-2-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like:

```
https://github.com/davidkane9/project-2
```

It is a good idea to always start a new data science project with a Github repo.


### Exercise 2

Connect the `project-2` Github repo to an R project on your computer. Name the R project `project-2` also. Keeping the names of repos/projects aligned makes organization simpler. From the Terminal, run `ls`. CP/CR.

```{r project-2-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like this:

```
Davids-MBP:project-2 dkane$ ls
README.md               project-2.Rproj
Davids-MBP:project-2 dkane$
```

The default README has an "md" suffix to indicate that it is a **M**ark**d**own document.

RStudio will automatically restart and place you within the `project-1` R project. You should also have a directory called `project-1` in the location in which you store your projects.

### Exercise 3

Go to File, New File, Quarto Document. Name it `Quarto-2`. From the Terminal, run `ls`. CP/CR.

```{r project-2-3}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Place correct answer here.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

<!-- Knowledge Drop -->

### Exercise 4

We will start with `eval: false`. Create a new code chunk and within it put 

```{r project-2-4}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Place correct answer here.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

###

eval: false prevents code from being evaluated. (And obviously if the code is not run, no results will be generated). This is useful for displaying example code, or for disabling a large block of code without commenting each line.

### Exercise 5



```{r project-2-5}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Place correct answer here.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

## Summary
### 

This tutorial covered material which is not actually in [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. But the material is in keeping with the spirit of that book. The material covered in [Chapter 4  Workflow: code style](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-style.html) appears in the *RStudio and Code* tutorial in this package.

You should now have Git working on your computer. You should have a Github account and know how to connect Github *repositories* to RStudio *projects*.

The most useful reference for Git/Github/RStudio is *[Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)*. Bookmark it!
