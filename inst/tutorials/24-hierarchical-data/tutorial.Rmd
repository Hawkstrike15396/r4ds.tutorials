## Introduction
### 

This tutorial covers [Chapter 24: Hierarchical data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/rectangling.html) from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. You will learn how to work with non-rectanglar data using packages like [**jsonlite**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/vignettes/json-aaquickstart.html). 


## JSON files 
### 

An increasingly common format for sharing data is JavaScript Object Notation or JSON. 

JSON is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax.

### Exercise 1

Consider the contents of the file `test_1.json`:

```{r}
cat(readLines("data/test_1.json"), sep = "\n")
```

### 

Write code for reading this JSON file into R as a tibble. Use the `fromJSON()` function from the [**jsonlite**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/vignettes/json-aaquickstart.html) package.

```{r json-files-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r json-files-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
fromJSON("data/test_1.json")
```

### 

If there are "null" values in the file, you can specify how to encode those values with the `null` argument in `fromJSON`.


### Exercise 2

Consider the following tibble, which is saved in the environment as an object called `example_1`.

```{r}
tibble(name= c("Miguel", "Sofia", "Aya", "Cheng"), 
                student_id = 1:4, exam_1 = c(85, 94, 87, 90), 
                exam_2 = c(86, 93, 88, 91))
```

### 

Write code to convert the following tibble into JSON format. Use the `toJSON()` function from the **jsonlite** package.

```{r json-files-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r json-files-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
toJSON(example_1)
```

### 

`toJSON()` actually has the same arguments as `fromJSON()`, meaning that you can use `null`, `na`, `pretty` and many more arguments to customize the results.

### Exercise 3

After converting from a tibble to the JSON format, it is hard to read the JSON format. To fix this, use the previous code and set the second argument `pretty` equal to `TRUE`.

```{r json-files-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r json-files-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
toJSON(example_1, pretty = ...)
```

### 

The `pretty` argument comes from the [**prettify**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/papeR/versions/1.0-5/topics/prettify) package, run `??prettify` to learn more about it.


### Exercise 4

Try reading from the `json` object which has already been loaded with JSON array data. Use `fromJSON()` to display the data in a tibble.

```{r json-files-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r json-files-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
fromJSON(json)
```

### 

As you can see, `fromJSON()` can display arrays as well, which can be useful for datasets that include matrices. You can do math operations with them as well! 

### Exercise 5

You can also write information like arrays or matrices to a JSON format using `toJSON()`. 

Display a 3x3 array in JSON format by creating 3 arrays structured like `[1, 2, 3]`, containing them in a larger array, and then passing them into `toJSON()`.

```{r json-files-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r json-files-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
json2 <- '[[..., ..., ...], [..., ..., ...], [..., ..., ...]]'

```

```{r json-files-5-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
json2 <- '[[..., ..., ...], [..., ..., ...], [..., ..., ...]]'
toJSON(json2)
```

### 

Because JSON files can so easily store complex matrix data, they're often used in APIs and websites. This makes `fromJSON()` invaluable when you're pulling data off the Internet, as the data will often come in a JSON file. 

Vice versa, `toJSON()` is useful for when you want to send data across the Internet due to its light weight (there's very little extra formatting included in the file and it's mostly data).
