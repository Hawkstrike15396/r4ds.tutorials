## Priorities

Write chapter 11. Lots of work to do! Remove all uses of primer.data.

Rewrite Chapter 2 to remove all uses of primer.data. Perhaps make it more like the book? If it is too short, we might add one of the plots from chapter 32, but only if (almost) all the tricks used there are covered in the chapter.

* Chapter 26 (functions)

* Chapter 27 (iterations)

* Chapter 28 (base R).

Rewrite Chapter 1. Remove all primer.data. Make it much nicer! What should be covered? Connect to actual chapter 1. Maybe include some material from r4ds-material-to-add.txt. Preceptor

Split up current tidycensus tutorials into indvidual chapters. Order them as in the book. We want tidycensus.tutorials to be as much a book companion as r4ds.tutorials is. Expand to cover other chapters.

Work on Primer chapters, and the tutorials for those chapters. Lots to do!

Why don't links open if you pull out the tutorial into its own window?

Add last section to chapter 4.

Clean up chapters 6.

## Zayan

Do chapter 22 tutorial. Submit PRs for it.

Write chapter 23 arrow.

## Mann

last fixes on 22 Databases tutorial.

General clean up and error question, especially of the tutorials. Change numbers to be new chapters.

Read Chapter 4, do tutorial. Notice questions about key assumptions and terms.

Read Chapter 5, do tutorial. Notice we don't have those questions. Add questions about Wisdom. 


## Srihith

chapter 12.

Work on chapter 12, which we need to finish by Friday.

  Remove the two plots which use primer.data. 
  Add one of the plots from tutorial 31, whichever one is most relevant. Note you need to add the data and the extra set up R code as well.

## Anish

Write chapter 24 hierchical data.

Talk about image sizes in earlier chapters.

## Matthew

Do the Getting Started tutorial from tutorial.helpers. Submit a PR if you notice anything.

The RStudio and Github tutorial is the best guide of our current practices. Email me the answers. Do it (and submit a PR with lots of fixes) before starting this. Key is to always make students prove that they have completed each step, and help them to know that everything is OK. 

The Quarto Websites tutorial is similar. Email me the answers in html. Do it (and submit a PR with lots of fixes) before starting this. I am not sure if those two follow the same practices when it comes to creating Github repos, restarting the RStudio session and so on. You should figure out the best practices and have all three tutorials use the same approach.

In both, try to replace Terminal CP/CR with Console CP/CR. Sometimes there is no way to avoid the Terminal, like with "quarto publish".

Read first three chapters of R Packages 2(e)

Start working on a tutorial for chapter 1. See the instructions there. 

Big picture plan is: first learn about tutorials, then learn about packages, and then you will know enough to work on tutorial.helpers.

tutorial for Chapter 2 (the whole game) . Want to ensure that all students have made an R package. Maybe this goes in teaching.tutorials. Maybe rename it making.tutorials? creation.tutorials?

tutorial for chapters 14 and 15 from R packages 2e. Students need to learn how to make a test. Maybe this and chapter 2 go together?

tutorial for function documentation and vignettes? 

Do what is necessary to get this on CRAN. Start by shrinking the size.

## Mirriam

On vacation.


## Preceptor

Move Terminal to chapter 7 and Quarto Websites to chapter 30.

Each chapter ends with a "Graduation Exercise," allowing the student to create something, generally a plot, from scratch. This material is additional to whatever the chapter covered. It could be left out of the assignment by a professor who did not find the exercises useful. Everything in the Graduation Exercise was covered in this chapter, or in previous ones. The GE get more complex as you go through the book. At the beginning, they are just plots you do in the tutorial. Then, after RStudio and Code, they are plots which you do on your computer. Then, after RStudio and Github, they always start with a repo which you then connect to your computer. 

Each Graduation Exercise should use material specific to that chapter. So, for example, the GE for the Spreadsheet tutorial would start with some spreadsheet data. Also, each GE would increase in complexity and/or decrease in the specificity of the instructions provided. The first few would be very didactic and step-by-step. For the last few, the first question might just be: "Set up a new repo, connect to an R project on your computer, create a quarto document called `analysis.qmd`, render it, run list.files() at the Console, CP/CR." And so on. 

Need to make sure the early tutorials cover things like scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma_format()) since we use it in class in weeks 1 and 2.

Move Termnal to Chapter 7.

Expand Intro/Summary for Web scraping.

Chapter 16 tutorial. too_short = "debug" seems like a typo/

Get rid of group_by everywhere, except when absolutely necessary.




Get rid of primer.data everywhere. Good tibbles to use in place of those include diamonds, gss_cat (maybe storms), midwest, mpg,   (There are also several time series data sets, including txhousing.)

Think harder about what we need to import. For most packages, we can just use them in Suggests. When students do Start Tutorial a tutorial with such a package, they will be prompted to install it. And that is fine! However, that does not work with primer.data. (And with other Github packages?) So, students will be very confused.

Make use of https://ggplot2-book.org/ in lots of places. It is a great reference!

But! If we include primer.data in Imports, as we do now, then it gets installed at the start, along with r4ds.tutorials. Problem solved, subject to the next paragraph.

Get rid of NOTES concerning the primer.data and tutorial.helpers package. I *think* that the best approach is to import from them in the R/r4ds.tutorials-package.R documentation. Import the tutorial.helpers functions which are used for downloading. Also import the specific primer.data sets which are used in tutorials.

Move over remaining all.primer.tutorials.

Start Iteration tutorial. Move material from chapter 5 overview tutorial to it.

Might be nice if each middle chapter tutorial (like factors, dates and times, et cetera) finished with a beautiful plot which required the use of skills from that chapter to manipulate the data first. An example is babynames in Strings chapter.

Even better, instead of a line-by-line plot built in the tutorial, we should have students create this plot oustide of the tutorial. It should be an exercise, like RStudio and Github, which starts with a student making a repo, connecting it to an RStudio project, starting a quarto document, loading libraries and data, building a plot, rendering the document so it looks nice and then publishing the plot on the web. Students need more practice with all these steps.

Make more use of RStudio User Guide: https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/

Maybe File -> like commands should be in italics, not backticks? That seems to be the way that R4DS does it.

Review RStudio and Code. Include material from r4ds-material

Review RStudio and Github. Include material from r4ds-material

Review Quarto Websites. Include material from r4ds-material

Review Terminal. Include material from r4ds-material

## Shrink Package

The project is too big, almost 20 mb now. There are some 1 mb or bigger images in RStudio and Code tutorial, and perhaps elsewhere. Shrink them. Or maybe these are all gifs and they can't be shrunk? CRAN does not like packages bigger than 5 mb.

* Decrease size of package. From this command:

find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*' -exec du -ah {} + | sort -rh | head -n 10
1.2M    ./inst/tutorials/05-rstudio-and-github/images/gist_push.gif
1.2M    ./inst/tutorials/03-rstudio-and-code/images/new_quarto_doc.gif
1.1M    ./inst/tutorials/09-workflow-getting-help/images/reprex_addin.gif
1.1M    ./inst/tutorials/03-rstudio-and-code/images/rpubs-9.png
1.0M    ./inst/tutorials/32-visualization-case-studies/images/nyt-plot.png
852K    ./inst/tutorials/32-visualization-case-studies/images/coffee_plot.png
808K    ./inst/tutorials/05-rstudio-and-github/images/gist_proj.gif
776K    ./inst/tutorials/05-rstudio-and-github/images/new_project.png
644K    ./inst/tutorials/02-data-visualization/tutorial.html
608K    ./inst/tutorials/03-rstudio-and-code/images/new_project_2.png

* Or maybe we could store these gifs elsewhere and have the tutorial load them from the web, if it is web connected?

* Don't worry about the size of html files since those are not included in the build of the package because of this line in .Rbuildignore:

tutorials/[^/]*/(?!(data|images|.*Rmd))

## Other thoughts

* You can also invalidate stored work by changing the ID or version of your tutorial. If you publish tutorials within R packages then the version is automatically derived from the version of the package.
