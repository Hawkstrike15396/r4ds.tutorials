## Anish

Work on 2  Data visualization tutorials.

Do the web scraping tutorial and submit a PR with fixes/comments/questions.

## Mirriam

Data tidying

## Preceptor

Need a test case for prep_rstudio_settings().

Delete dependence of readr and stringr from prep_rstudio_settings().

The project is too big. There are some 1 mb or bigger images in RStudio and Code tutorial, and perhaps elsewhere. Shrink them. Or maybe these are all gifs and they can't be shrunk? I would prefer for this tutorial to have no NOTES with R CMD check.

Start thinking about which all.primer.tutorials to move over. Most importantly, I think a lot of the plotting practice and visualization examples is still worth while. But where to put them? One approach is to add inidvidual examples into sensible r4ds tutorials. They would be at the end, as extra practice. Many/most of the r4ds tutorials seem a little short. Another approach to add them as appendices, extra practice, making it clear which chapters you need to have completed to have the knowledge to do them. One annoyance is that many of them use primer.data . . . and I don't particularly like having this package depend on non-CRAN packages.




## Other thoughts

* You can also invalidate stored work by changing the ID or version of your tutorial. If you publish tutorials within R packages then the version is automatically derived from the version of the package.
