## Anish

Work on 2  Data visualization tutorials.

Do the web scraping tutorial and submit a PR with fixes/comments/questions.

## Mirriam

Finish check and fixes on data tidying.


## Preceptor


Move over remaining all.primer.tutorials.


Add visualization-tidyverse to chapter 4.


Finish off 033-data-files.

Start middle chapters of R4DS.

Maybe File -> like commands should be in italics, not backticks? That seems to be the way that R4DS does it.

Split prep_rstudio_settings() in two parts. The first would keep the name and just do those settings changes. The second would modify the .Rprofile, maybe add_binary_to_rprofile()?

The project is too big. There are some 1 mb or bigger images in RStudio and Code tutorial, and perhaps elsewhere. Shrink them. Or maybe these are all gifs and they can't be shrunk? CRAN does not like packages bigger than 5 mb.


Review RStudio and Code. Include material from r4ds-material

Review RStudio and Github. Include material from r4ds-material

Review Quarto Websites. Include material from r4ds-material

Review Terminal.

Add a Setting the Stage tutorial which points users to the Getting Started tutorial and has them run prep_rstudio_settings().


## Other thoughts

* You can also invalidate stored work by changing the ID or version of your tutorial. If you publish tutorials within R packages then the version is automatically derived from the version of the package.
