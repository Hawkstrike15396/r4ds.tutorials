For RStudio and Github, add three exercises at the end which run the whole process from start to published plot on Rpubs.

## Priorities

Why does testing on Windows take 15 minutes, while testing on Mac takes < 3? Would be nice to fix this so that we could start testing on CRAN again.

Would be nice to do at least some testing of knitting the tutorials on CRAN.

Finish public project in logical vectors.

Add labels to test chunks so that errors are easier to find. Need to adjust Format Tutorial Code Labels from tutorial.helpers to account for this.

Rewrite chapter 10, adding knowledge drops and test code chunks.

Rewrite Chapter 1. Maybe include some material from r4ds-material-to-add.txt. 

Fix Quarto Websites to not have file names with minus signs in them, like car-plot.

Why don't links open if you pull out the tutorial into its own window?

Each chapter ends with a "Graduation Exercise," allowing the student to create something, generally a plot, from scratch. This material is additional to whatever the chapter covered. It could be left out of the assignment by a professor who did not find the exercises useful. Everything in the Graduation Exercise was covered in this chapter, or in previous ones. The GE get more complex as you go through the book. At the beginning, they are just plots you do in the tutorial. Then, after RStudio and Code, they are plots which you do on your computer. Then, after RStudio and Github, they always start with a repo which you then connect to your computer. 

Each Graduation Exercise should use material specific to that chapter. So, for example, the GE for the Spreadsheet tutorial would start with some spreadsheet data. Also, each GE would increase in complexity and/or decrease in the specificity of the instructions provided. The first few would be very didactic and step-by-step. For the last few, the first question might just be: "Set up a new repo, connect to an R project on your computer, create a quarto document called `analysis.qmd`, render it, run list.files() at the Console, CP/CR." And so on.

Need to make sure the early tutorials cover things like scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma_format()) since we use it in class in weeks 1 and 2.

Looks like we could stop using Rpubs because Quarto Pub allows you to publish a single document:

quarto publish quarto-pub document.qmd

Expand Intro/Summary for Web scraping.

Chapter 16 tutorial. too_short = "debug" seems like a typo/

Get rid of group_by everywhere, except when absolutely necessary.


Good tibbles to use include diamonds, gss_cat (maybe storms), midwest, mpg,   (There are also several time series data sets, including txhousing.)

Think harder about what we need to import. For most packages, we can just use them in Suggests. When students do Start Tutorial a tutorial with such a package, they will be prompted to install it. And that is fine! 

Make use of https://ggplot2-book.org/ in lots of places. It is a great reference!

Might be nice if each middle chapter tutorial (like factors, dates and times, et cetera) finished with a beautiful plot which required the use of skills from that chapter to manipulate the data first. An example is babynames in Strings chapter.

Even better, instead of a line-by-line plot built in the tutorial, we should have students create this plot oustide of the tutorial. It should be an exercise, like RStudio and Github, which starts with a student making a repo, connecting it to an RStudio project, starting a quarto document, loading libraries and data, building a plot, rendering the document so it looks nice and then publishing the plot on the web. Students need more practice with all these steps.

Make more use of RStudio User Guide: https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/

Maybe File -> like commands should be in italics, not backticks? That seems to be the way that R4DS does it.

Review RStudio and Code. Include material from r4ds-material

Review RStudio and Github. Include material from r4ds-material

Review Quarto Websites. Include material from r4ds-material

Review Terminal. Include material from r4ds-material

## Other thoughts

* You can also invalidate stored work by changing the ID or version of your tutorial. If you publish tutorials within R packages then the version is automatically derived from the version of the package.
