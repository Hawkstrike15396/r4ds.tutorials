## Priorities




### Current items

Left off tutorial improvements at Chapter 14 (strings), which was completed.

Chapters 21, 22, 26 and 27 are OK, but could still use a lot of clean up.

Rewrite Introduction. Maybe include some material from r4ds-material-to-add.txt. 

Check to make sure that the plots only use things which have been taught, especially oecd and portland in chapters 10 and 11.

### Specific Chapter Issues


Q&A sections, at least in RStudio and Code.

Make more use of https://ggplot2-book.org/ and https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/

Maybe much of the material in Quarto R4DS chapter belongs in RStudio and Github chapter, allowing Quarto tutorial to focus on projects.

Do RStudio and Code and RStudio and Github tutorials link up well together? 

The styler package and its use seem important and worth discussing. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nAfJ-5nkcU&authuser=0 for other interesting options.


### Graduation Exercises

Jade's idea for "Exploration" sections at the end of each tutorial. Give students some choices. Let them explore. Let them make something. There is no wrong answer.

Might be nice if each middle chapter tutorial (like factors, dates and times, et cetera) finished with a beautiful plot which required the use of skills from that chapter to manipulate the data first. An example is babynames in Strings chapter.

Even better, instead of a line-by-line plot built in the tutorial, we should have students create this plot oustide of the tutorial. It should be an exercise, like RStudio and Github, which starts with a student making a repo, connecting it to an RStudio project, starting a quarto document, loading libraries and data, building a plot, rendering the document so it looks nice and then publishing the plot on the web. Students need more practice with all these steps.
