Update to CRAN version of tutorial.helpers

Maybe File -> like commands should be in italics, not backticks? That seems to be the way that R4DS does it.

Need a test case for prep_rstudio_settings(). Maybe record the settings of each variable, then change them, then check to see if you did change them, then change them back. Maybe use some advanced testthat tricks for frameworks or whatever.

Delete dependence of readr and stringr from prep_rstudio_settings().

Split prep_rstudio_settings() in two parts. The first would keep the name and just do those settings changes. The second would modify the .Rprofile, maybe add_binary_to_rprofile()?

The project is too big. There are some 1 mb or bigger images in RStudio and Code tutorial, and perhaps elsewhere. Shrink them. Or maybe these are all gifs and they can't be shrunk? CRAN does not like packages bigger than 5 mb.

Update to tutorial.helpers on CRAN.

Fix test-tutorials.R code. Understand better which version of the package is being testing when we test. Explain that detail in the documentation for helper.tutorials.

Review RStudio and Code.

Review RStudio and Github.

Review Quarto Websites.

Review Terminal.

Add a Setting the Stage tutorial which points users to the Getting Started tutorial and has them run prep_rstudio_settings().

Start thinking about which all.primer.tutorials to move over. Most importantly, I think a lot of the plotting practice and visualization examples is still worth while. But where to put them? One approach is to add inidvidual examples into sensible r4ds tutorials. They would be at the end, as extra practice. Many/most of the r4ds tutorials seem a little short. Another approach to add them as appendices, extra practice, making it clear which chapters you need to have completed to have the knowledge to do them. One annoyance is that many of them use primer.data . . . and I don't particularly like having this package depend on non-CRAN packages.




## Other thoughts

* You can also invalidate stored work by changing the ID or version of your tutorial. If you publish tutorials within R packages then the version is automatically derived from the version of the package.
