Maybe File -> like commands should be in italics, not backticks? That seems to be the way that R4DS does it.

Review RStudio and Code. Include material from r4ds-material

Review RStudio and Github. Include material from r4ds-material

Review Quarto Websites. Include material from r4ds-material

Review Terminal. Include material from r4ds-material

## Shrink Package

The project is too big. There are some 1 mb or bigger images in RStudio and Code tutorial, and perhaps elsewhere. Shrink them. Or maybe these are all gifs and they can't be shrunk? CRAN does not like packages bigger than 5 mb.

* Decrease size of package. From this command:

find . -type f -exec du -a {} + | sort -n -r | head -n 10


Biggest file is this one:

./inst/tutorials/11-exploratory-data-analysis/data/owid-covid-data.csv 

Do we need it? Can we just download it live>

Then there are these files:

2464    ./inst/tutorials/05-rstudio-and-github/images/gist_push.gif
2360    ./inst/tutorials/03-rstudio-and-code/images/new_quarto_doc.gif
2336    ./inst/tutorials/09-workflow-getting-help/images/reprex_addin.gif
2280    ./inst/tutorials/03-rstudio-and-code/images/rpubs-9.png
2048    ./inst/tutorials/32-visualization-case-studies/images/nyt-plot.png
1704    ./inst/tutorials/32-visualization-case-studies/images/coffee_plot.png

They would all be much smaller

## Other thoughts

* You can also invalidate stored work by changing the ID or version of your tutorial. If you publish tutorials within R packages then the version is automatically derived from the version of the package.
